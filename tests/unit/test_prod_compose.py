"""Structural gates on the production stack, and on the two environments beside it.

``docker compose config`` proves the file parses and that every variable it
interpolates has a value. It cannot prove the things this stack has to be: that
no dev-only switch survived into it, that nothing but the TLS edge is reachable
from the host, that the services which construct ``Settings()`` all say
``production``, that every image is the one CI published rather than one the
box built for itself, and that the variable contract and its example file are
still the same contract. Those are the claims the deployment rests on, so they
are asserted here rather than remembered.

The last section covers the other two environments, because both are defined
*against* this one and neither can protect that relationship on its own:

* staging is ``docker-compose.prod.yml`` with a thin overlay, so what has to be
  asserted is that the overlay stays thin — a staging stack that diverges in
  topology has stopped rehearsing the thing it exists to rehearse — and that a
  service added to production cannot be left saying ``production`` in staging;
* dev is ``docker-compose.yml`` + ``docker-compose.demo.yml`` and deliberately
  has no third file, which is a decision rather than an omission and so is
  asserted here where the next person to reach for one will find the reasoning.

Nothing in this module starts a container or reads the network.
