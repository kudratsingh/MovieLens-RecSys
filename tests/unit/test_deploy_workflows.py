"""Structural properties of the three workflows that build and ship production.

Nothing in this repository executes ``.github/workflows/ci.yml``'s
``publish-images`` job, ``deploy-production.yml`` or ``production-canary.yml`` —
GitHub does, against a Hetzner box — so the properties whose violation is
invisible until a release goes wrong are the ones worth pinning here.

Most of them are couplings across files that no single file can protect:

* the required-check list against the jobs ``ci.yml`` actually declares, so a
  renamed, deleted or newly added CI job cannot leave the deploy gate quietly
  asserting nothing;
* the published image names against the services ``docker-compose.prod.yml``
  builds, because an image the publish job forgets is an image the host cannot
  pull and would have to build for itself — which is the one thing the host is
  never asked to do;
* the image namespace against the default the same Compose file resolves when
  ``IMAGE_REPOSITORY`` is unset (``infra/deploy/production.env.example`` carries
  the same string), because a publish job and a host that disagree about the
  namespace is a deploy that pulls a tag nobody pushed;
* the sentinels against ``infra/deploy/deploy.sh`` and ``src/release``, which is
  where the scripts that print them define the literals;
* the k6 pin against ``infra/ci/k6-version``, since a Dockerfile cannot read a
  file to build its own ``FROM`` line and ADR 0010 makes that version the thing
  that stops local and CI measurements drifting apart;
* the two plan-named gates ``api-contract-check`` and ``web-api-types-check``,
  which are *steps* rather than jobs. Requiring the ``lint`` and ``frontend``
  jobs is what requiring those two checks means, and that only stays true while
  the steps are still in those jobs.

The sentinel match is exercised with the real ``grep`` rather than a
reimplementation of its pattern, because the property that matters —
``VERIFY-OK`` must not be satisfied by a run that printed ``VERIFY-SUBSET-OK``
— is a property of that regular expression under that tool.
